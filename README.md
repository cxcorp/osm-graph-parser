Java program that parses OSM XML files into a json graph representation. 

## Example

In output file you will have nodes and edges (highways in real world) with weight (unit: `centimetres`).
```json
[
  {
    "la": 60.1570875,
    "lo": 24.9563234,
    "e": [
      {
        "i": 1,
        "w": 514
      },
      {
        "i": 17,
        "w": 574
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "la": 60.1570488,
    "lo": 24.9562727,
    "e": [
      {
        "i": 0,
        "w": 514
      },
      {
        "i": 2,
        "w": 784
      },
      {
        "i": 11302,
        "w": 413
      }
    ]
  }
 ]
 ```
 
 ### How to read that json
 ```
 la = latitude
 lo = longitude
 e = edges
 i = main array index, if the i is 0 it refers to the first element in the array
 w = weight
 ```
## Getting Started

1. [Download](https://github.com/rovaniemi/osm-graph-parser/releases) latest version under the releases tab.
2. [Download](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) openstreetmap data. (click export, select area, and then export)
3. Make directory called `map` in the directory where you have downloaded .jar file.
4. Name osm file to map-01.osm, if you have multiple osm files name them like `map-01.map`, `map-02.map` etc. and put them in map directory.
5. Now your tree should look like this. ![img](http://imgur.com/ntvFUQN.png)
6. Run the jar file. (terminal `java -jar <jar-file-name>.jar`)
7. Now you have `graph.json` in the same directory where the .jar file is.
8. If you use this data in your own service read [openstreetmap licence.](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/)

### Possible errors

1. Parsing take much time or program crash.
    - You need more memory for the program. Change java run command to `java -jar -Xmx4096m <jar-file-name>.jar`. That will increase java heap max size to 4gb. You will need 4gb ram for that. If you parse huge map you will need bigger heap size.

### Prerequisites

You will need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run java programs. You can download it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html).
