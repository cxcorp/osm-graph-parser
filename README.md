Java program that parses OSM XML files into a json graph representation. 

## Example

In output file you will have nodes and edges (highways in real world) with weight (unit: `centimetres`).
```json
[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "lat": 65.8504211,
    "lon": 24.145322,
    "edges": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "weight": 12854
      },
      {
        "id": 6804,
        "weight": 12732
      },
      {
        "id": 6811,
        "weight": 11897
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "lat": 65.8501013,
    "lon": 24.1480372,
    "edges": [
      {
        "id": 0,
        "weight": 12854
      },
      {
        "id": 7026,
        "weight": 12156
      },
      {
        "id": 11123,
        "weight": 742
      },
      {
        "id": 7017,
        "weight": 12240
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Getting Started

1. [Download](https://github.com/rovaniemi/osm-graph-parser/releases) latest version under the releases tab.
2. [Download](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) openstreetmap data. (click export, select area, and then export)
3. Make directory called `map` in the directory where you have downloaded .jar file.
4. Name osm file to map-01.osm, if you have multiple osm files name them like `map-01.map`, `map-02.map` etc. and put them in map directory.
5. Now your tree should look like this. ![img](http://imgur.com/ntvFUQN.png)
6. Run the jar file. (terminal `java -jar <jar-file-name>.jar`)
7. Now you have `graph.json` in the same directory where the .jar file is.
8. If you use this data in your own service read [openstreetmap licence.](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/)

### Possible errors

1. Parsing take much time or crash.
  - You need more memory for the program. Change java run command to `java -jar -Xmx4096m <jar-file-name>.jar`. That will increase java heap max size to 4gb. You will need 4gb ram for that.

### Prerequisites

You will need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run java programs. You can download it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html).
